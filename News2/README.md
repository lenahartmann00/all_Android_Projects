# NewsApp
An android application that shows up to 500 of the latest top stories in a list. Clicking on the news-title opens the referring article.
 
# What I learned
- downloading and reading WebContent (JSON-Files from Hacker-News-API)
- parsing data between multiple activities
- storing and updating data in SQLiteDatabase
- using ListView and WebView to list the news and show the article

# Usage
